# dev-utils

My dev utils, not really meant for public consumption, I'm just too cheap to spring for a private account :-)

Need to add a defines file contain the following:

```Shell
#!/bin/bash

export wc=(path to root of project, e.g. /var/www/html)
export PATH=$PATH:(add path to npm and nodejs here, e.g. /c/Users/User/AppData/Roaming/npm/:"/c/Program Files (x86)/nodejs/")
```
